# Tensor Network Moral Graph Recovery of Discrete Probability Distributions

## Abstract

> We present a method for recovering the moral graph of a causal DAG from a probability
> distribution over discrete variables, using fully connected tensor networks (FCTNs) with
> nuclear-norm-regularized bond corrections. Each bond matrix is parameterized as a baseline all-
> ones matrix plus a low-rank correction $C_{ij} = U_{ij}V_{ij}^\top$, and the nuclear norm of the
> correction implemented via the variational Frobenius norm penalty on the factors drives
> unnecessary bonds to zero. We prove that under faithfulness, positivity, and a no-implicit-
> rerouting assumption on the local tensor architecture, \textbf{every} optimal FCTN with zero
> reconstruction error $\varepsilon = 0$ has effective graph exactly equal to the moral graph. For
> the approximate regime ($\varepsilon > 0$), we provide explicit recovery bounds using the
> Fannes-Audenaert continuity of conditional mutual information, and derive a sufficient condition
> on the regularization parameter $β$. The effective graph is read directly from the optimized
> bond matrices.
