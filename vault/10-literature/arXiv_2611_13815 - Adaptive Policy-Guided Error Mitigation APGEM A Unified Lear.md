# Adaptive Policy-Guided Error Mitigation (APGEM): A Unified Learning-Based Framework for Noise Resilience in Quantum Machine Learning

## Abstract

> Error mitigation stands between variational quantum algorithms and useful results on today's
> noisy hardware, yet in practice a mitigation method is usually chosen once, by hand, and applied
> unchanged for the life of an experiment. This is a poor fit for quantum machine learning (QML),
> where the circuit and the noise drift as training proceeds, so the best strategy in one regime
> is often wrong in another. We present a generalized form of Adaptive Policy-Guided Error
> Mitigation (APGEM), which treats the choice of mitigation technique as an online decision made
> from an algorithm's own feedback. A single contextual-bandit controller observes signals any
> variational algorithm already produces, such as fidelity, entropy, reward or loss, and gradient
> behavior, and selects among Zero-Noise Extrapolation, Probabilistic Error Cancellation,
> Measurement Error Mitigation, Dynamical Decoupling, and circuit optimization per step. Because
> it depends only on this shared feedback interface, the framework applies unchanged across
> supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and hybrid quantum-classical learning. Evaluated on
> five paradigms across 80 algorithm-and-noise conditions, adaptive selection reaches 95.5% of an
> oracle that always picks the best technique and significantly outperforms all six fixed
> strategies (Friedman $χ^{2}=92.18$, $p\approx1.1\times10^{-17}$; pairwise Wilcoxon
> $p<4\times10^{-6}$). The learned policy is noise-aware: its favored technique shifts as
> depolarizing and readout error rise. On noise models from eight real IBM devices, APGEM tracks
> the oracle almost exactly (99.9% of oracle utility) at a flat cost of roughly $1.3\times10^{4}$
> shots from three to eight qubits.
