# Learning angles for quantum approximate optimization

## Abstract

> The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its variants are leading algorithms to
> help solve challenging combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA maps these problems to Ising
> Hamiltonians such that their ground state is the desired solution. Candidate solutions are then
> drawn from a variational quantum circuit. The performance of QAOA hinges on a set of variational
> angles. However, finding good angles is an instance-specific and computationally expensive non-
> convex classical optimization task. Here, we learn the mapping from the problem instance to
> high-quality QAOA angles. Our learned models replace the per-instance optimization, that we call
> the solver, with a single forward pass that is several orders of magnitude faster than the
> solver with a near identical quality. Our models further generalize to unseen topologies such as
> Barabási-Albert and 2D grid graphs. Experiments on quantum hardware confirm that QAOA samples
> with angles produced by our open-source models are indistinguishable from solver angles.
> Crucially, models sensitive to the topology of the problem instance increase the quality of the
> QAOA angles. Our work amortizes a major bottleneck in QAOA by an up-front data generation and
> training cost. Importantly, this cost can be amortized over time in settings where many similar
> problems are optimized on a regular basis, as is often the case in applications for industry.
