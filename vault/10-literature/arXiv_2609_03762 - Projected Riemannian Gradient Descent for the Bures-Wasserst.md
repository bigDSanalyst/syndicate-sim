# Projected Riemannian Gradient Descent for the Bures-Wasserstein Barycenter: Dimension-Independent Linear Convergence at Unit Step Size

## Abstract

> The computation of the Bures-Wasserstein (BW) barycenter of an ensemble of positive definite
> matrices arises throughout machine learning, optimal transport, and quantum information.
> Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) at unit step size -- the fixed-point iteration used in
> practice -- converges rapidly, yet existing analyses present a dichotomy: unit-step guarantees
> carry worst-case exponential dependence on the dimension, while dimension-independent guarantees
> require small step sizes that forfeit the empirical speed. We resolve this dichotomy, not by
> improving the guarantees for unit-step RGD, but by proposing a Projected RGD algorithm that
> achieves dimension-independent linear convergence at unit step size. The achieved rate, $(1 -
> κ^{-3/2})$, where $κ$ is the condition number of the ensemble, also polynomially improves on the
> best small-step guarantee ($κ^{3/2}$ versus $κ^{5/2}$ iteration complexity). The crux is a novel
> Projection Lemma: clipping the eigenvalues of a positive matrix to an interval $[α, β]$ is the
> closed-form, non-expansive (1-Lipschitz) BW-metric projection onto the set $\{S : αI \leq S \leq
> βI\}$ -- a statement which, unlike its known one-sided counterpart, does not follow from
> convexity. The projection is moreover free: it reuses an eigendecomposition the next iteration
> must perform in any case, so the projected and unprojected iterations cost the same per step.
> The same analysis covers the invariant matrix projection problem of Brahmachari et al. (2025),
> whose fixed-point algorithm we identify as unit-step RGD on a totally geodesic submanifold,
> thereby extending the dimension-independent guarantee to that setting verbatim.
