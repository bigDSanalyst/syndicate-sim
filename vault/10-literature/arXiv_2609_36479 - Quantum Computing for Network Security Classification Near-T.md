# Quantum Computing for Network Security Classification: Near-Term Classification and Long-Term Memory Efficiency

## Abstract

> Quantum computing has already been explored in several network-security applications. However,
> how quantum computing may contribute to network-security classification in both the near term
> and the longer term has not been systematically discussed. This paper studies this question
> through two complementary experiments. First, we evaluate near-term quantum-kernel support
> vector machines (SVMs) on practical network-security classification tasks and compare them with
> classical SVM baselines on KDD Cup 1999, CICIDS2017, and BoT-IoT. Across these runs, quantum
> kernels are competitive. They can match or improve classical baselines in some settings, while
> classical RBF kernels remain stronger in others. This suggests that near-term quantum-kernel
> methods should be evaluated as practical, dataset-dependent alternatives to classical kernels
> rather than as uniformly superior replacements. Second, we use quantum oracle sketching (QOS) to
> study a longer-term memory advantage for classification with streaming classical samples. In
> QOS, samples are processed online and used to incrementally construct an approximate quantum
> oracle, which provides coherent query access for downstream quantum algorithms without retaining
> the entire dataset. Under the QOS-inspired machine-size estimate, comparable accuracy
> corresponds to a substantially smaller effective memory-size proxy than explicit sparse/QRAM-
> style storage. Compared with a simple streaming proxy, the result is more nuanced because
> aggressive feature filtering can make the streaming dimension small. This suggests that the
> long-term value of quantum computing for network-security classification may lie in memory-
> efficient data access rather than immediate runtime speedup. Together, these experiments show
> how quantum computing may contribute to network-security classification from near-term
> classification performance and longer-term memory efficiency.
