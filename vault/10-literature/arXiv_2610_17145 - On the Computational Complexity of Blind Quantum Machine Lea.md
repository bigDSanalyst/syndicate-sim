# On the Computational Complexity of Blind Quantum Machine Learning

## Abstract

> Can quantum advantages in computational efficiency coexist with quantum advantages in privacy?
> In this paper, we construct and use MasonQ, a universal brickwork transpiler, to answer this
> question with a resounding yes. We approach this question by bridging two seemingly disparate
> paradigms: universal blind quantum computation (UBQC), based on measurement-based quantum
> computation, and quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms such as the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd
> (HHL) algorithm and quantum recommendation systems. We provide new upper bounds on the depth of
> UBQC brickwork graphs, establishing that $D = \mathcal{O}(ωn)$, where $ω$ is the circuit width
> and $n$ its computational gate complexity. This is enabled by our newly developed transpiler
> MasonQ, which maps arbitrary quantum circuits to computational brickwork graph states. Given an
> optimal Qiskit circuit as input, we prove optimality (up to logarithmic corrections) of the
> MasonQ transpiler in terms of asymptotic scaling of the total brickwork graph width and depth
> after decomposition into bricks, enabling systematic cost analyses of blind implementations in
> near-term experiments and asymptotic regimes. Leveraging MasonQ, we derive depth bounds for
> several representative blind quantum machine learning (B-QML) algorithms, including the quantum
> Fourier transform, the HHL algorithm, recommendation systems, and quantum transformers. Lastly,
> we analyze concrete resource estimates for near-term demonstrations of blind quantum machine
> learning. We propose a minimal B-QML implementation requiring only a $12$ qubit quantum server.
> To the best of our knowledge, MasonQ is the first functional and optimal universal circuit-to-
> brickwork-graph transpiler to implement the full brickwork transpilation process from first
> principles.
