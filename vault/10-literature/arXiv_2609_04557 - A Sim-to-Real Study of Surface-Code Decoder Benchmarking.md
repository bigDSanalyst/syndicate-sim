# A Sim-to-Real Study of Surface-Code Decoder Benchmarking

## Abstract

> Quantum error-correction decoders are typically benchmarked against synthetic circuit-level
> noise, under the assumption that a decoder's ranking under such noise transfers to hardware and
> improves as the noise model becomes more realistic. The Willow processor, the first to operate
> below the surface-code threshold, allows us to test this assumption. We rank a panel of six
> decoders using a four-rung ladder of noise models with increasing fidelity, evaluated against
> real data across three code distances, two bases, and fifteen round counts. Rank agreement with
> hardware appears once the noise model gives each operation type its own error rate. Calibrating
> the model to the device improves absolute error rates but not rank agreement. We additionally
> provide the first independent evaluation of NVIDIA's Ising pre-decoder on hardware, at code
> distances below its training receptive field and via a mapping onto the lattice on which it was
> trained. Under these conditions, it holds no accuracy-latency advantage: another panel decoder
> matches or improves on it in both per-cycle error rate and decode latency in 278 of the 280
> evaluations. We release the full pipeline and the per-shot outcome of every evaluation, so
> future decoders and devices can be compared.
