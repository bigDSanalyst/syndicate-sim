# Quantum machine learning geospatial time-series by seasonal encoding

## Abstract

> Quantum data reuploading models can increase the expressive capacity of variational quantum
> models, but do not necessarily improve predictive performance. In the present work, we
> investigate this behavior for seasonal time series forecasting and show that data encoding
> determines how well temporal structures are represented as circuit depth increases. We develop a
> fidelity-based quantum geometric description in which repeated encodings contribute to an
> effective input generator, so that reuploading depth changes the quantum geometry through which
> approximately recurrent inputs are distinguished. We construct fixed and adaptive seasonal
> encodings that represent observation magnitude and seasonal phase in distinct Bloch-sphere
> coordinates. We evaluate these encodings for monthly precipitation derived from ERA5-Land, a
> global reanalysis dataset, from a representative semi-arid, drought-prone tropical region in
> East Africa, using a 14-month lag window and reuploading depths $L$= 1-6. We find that in ideal
> simulations, standard value-based encodings degrade markedly with depth, whereas adaptive
> seasonal encodings preserve temporal correlation, spectral structure, and forecasting accuracy.
> Noisy simulations show that this encoding hierarchy persists at shallow and intermediate depths,
> while larger depths are limited by circuit noise and optimization difficulty. The seasonal
> quantum models remain competitive with established classical forecasting methods (ARIMA, random
> forests, and LSTMs). These results identify structure-aware quantum data encoding as a general
> strategy for building deeper quantum reuploading models.
