# Q-Capsule: A Localized Capsule-Based Quantum Neural Architecture for Barren Plateau Mitigation

## Abstract

> Variational quantum algorithms are often limited by barren plateaus: gradients vanish as circuit
> size and depth increase, making quantum neural networks difficult to train. We propose
> Q-Capsule, a localized capsule-based quantum neural architecture that mitigates this problem
> through register partitioning, local readout, sparse inter-capsule coupling, trainable data re-
> uploading, and Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM)-guided adaptive depth growth. By
> restricting the dominant support of each observable to a small capsule and controlling inter-
> capsule entanglement, Q-Capsule preserves useful gradient signals while retaining communication
> between local quantum representations. As the register width increases, Q-Capsule consistently
> maintains stable gradient variance, whereas globally entangling baselines exhibit exponential
> suppression with a log-gradient-variance slope near -ln 2 per qubit. Q-Capsule also produces
> more structured optimization landscapes, higher parameter efficiency, improved robustness to
> depolarizing noise, and lower measurement requirements. Its adaptive policy achieves 98.1%
> accuracy on binary classification and 97.7% on four-class classification, while using
> approximately 73% fewer two-qubit gates than the fixed-deep model on the multiclass task.
