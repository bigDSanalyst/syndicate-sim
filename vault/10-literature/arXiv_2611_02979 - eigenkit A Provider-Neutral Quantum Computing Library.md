# eigenkit: A Provider-Neutral Quantum Computing Library

## Abstract

> Quantum software ecosystems provide increasingly capable tools for simulation and hardware
> execution, but differences in programming models, supported features, and backend capabilities
> can make it difficult to move and systematically compare the same quantum algorithm across
> execution environments. We introduce eigenkit, a provider-neutral quantum computing library that
> separates algorithm definition from backend execution through a common circuit representation
> and provider interface. The library currently supports 12 execution providers spanning
> simulators and quantum hardware, provides backend-independent gradient computation, and
> integrates with standard scientific-computing and machine-learning workflows through NumPy,
> PyTorch, and scikit-learn interfaces. We evaluate the practical relevance of this abstraction
> across both simulation and quantum hardware. Simulator performance varies substantially with
> circuit size, structure, batching, and application workload, showing that no single backend is
> consistently preferable. On quantum hardware, experiments on IBM Heron and IQM Emerald show that
> which processor is better suited to a given algorithm depends not only on hardware constraints,
> but also on how well the topology of the quantum algorithm matches the physical connectivity of
> the processor. These results demonstrate that backend portability is not only a software-design
> convenience, but can be important for both computational efficiency and quantum execution
> quality.
