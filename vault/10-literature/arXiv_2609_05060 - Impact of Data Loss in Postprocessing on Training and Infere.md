# Impact of Data Loss in Postprocessing on Training and Inference of Quantum Neural Networks

## Abstract

> As quantum hardware scales to larger devices, the classical software layers that interface with
> it must evolve in step. Postprocessing routines developed and tested primarily in simulator
> settings can encode assumptions that no longer hold on utility-scale devices, leading to data
> loss that can be difficult to detect from high-level model outputs alone. We present a case
> study of \texttt{SamplerQNN}, the sampling-based quantum neural network class in the Qiskit
> Machine Learning library. Here, the postprocessing method applies a filter that assumes
> measurement bit-strings are in virtual qubit space. On our quantum hardware runs, where bit-
> strings span over 100 physical qubits, this filter led to the loss of 85 to 99.6\% of valid
> measurement shots, depending on the transpiler's qubit placement. The resulting probability
> vector is unnormalised, allowing distorted prediction and loss values to propagate through the
> model without an API-level warning. We demonstrate the impact across five experiments on two IBM
> backends: for inference, accuracy drops from 0.94 to 0.39 on the same raw measurements; for
> training, the loss signal is compressed by 22 to 27$\times$, substantially reducing the
> sensitivity of the optimiser to the objective landscape. The behaviour arises in all released
> versions of the library (0.8.4 to 0.9.0). We implemented a layout-based marginalisation fix,
> merged into the GitHub codebase as Pull Request \#1041, that makes \texttt{SamplerQNN}
> postprocessing forward-compatible with current and upcoming hardware.
