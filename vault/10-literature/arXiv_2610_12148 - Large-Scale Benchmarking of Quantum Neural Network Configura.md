# Large-Scale Benchmarking of Quantum Neural Network Configurations for Financial Time Series Forecasting

## Abstract

> Quantum machine learning, and quantum neural networks (QNNs) in particular, are advancing fields
> with growing potential. Although systematic comparisons of QNN configurations have been explored
> primarily for classification tasks, comparatively little attention has been given to regression
> problems, particularly financial time series forecasting. This study presents a large-scale
> systematic comparative evaluation of QNN component configurations for financial time series
> forecasting, using the GBP/USD spot exchange rate as a case study. A grid search across encoding
> methods, ansatz designs, qubit counts, layer depths, and cost functions yields 1,368 distinct
> model configurations, each evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy, computational cost, and
> convergence behaviour. The results reveal unique insights into how the choice of methods
> influences performance, such as that gate selection and arrangement are more critical to model
> success than raw parameter count, and that entanglement is a system-level property of the full
> circuit rather than solely at the ansatz level. The best-performing QNN configuration achieves
> an $R^2$ score of 0.985, outperforming a classical BiLSTM baseline. Additionally, the impact of
> real quantum hardware noise is assessed through execution on the IQM Emerald device, revealing
> that gate errors and decoherence represent a significant barrier to practical deployment, with
> gate selection and circuit depth identified as key determinants of hardware noise resilience.
> Overall, the findings provide practical architectural guidance for QNN design and establish a
> baseline characterisation of QNN noise sensitivity on near-term quantum devices.
