# Same Spectrum, Harder First-Order Training: Phase-Locking in Single- versus Multi-Qubit Re-Uploading Circuits

## Abstract

> Angle-encoded variational quantum circuits implement truncated Fourier series. For one-
> dimensional inputs, a single-qubit re-uploading (serial) circuit represents every function that
> a multi-qubit circuit with the same encoding budget $E$ can; we find that this exchange of width
> for depth is not free in first-order training. Because its state lives on the Bloch sphere, all
> parameters of the serial circuit move the state, at each input, along one complex direction,
> which we call \emph{phase-locking}. We prove that this costs no Fourier direction but leaves no
> direction to spare: however many parameters it has, the serial circuit has at most $2E+2$
> tangent directions, one more than its $2E+1$ Fourier coefficients need, while a two-qubit
> control with the same encoding budget and model class generically has at least $6E+6$. The cost
> in training is measured against this control, as the number of runs out of 100 that reach the
> optimum within a fixed step budget. On an exact loss with flat-spectrum targets the gap grows
> with $E$; at $E=32$ the serial circuit converges in 3, 53 and 83 runs under gradient descent,
> Adam and Levenberg--Marquardt, the control in 99, 100 and 100. On three real-world series, at
> matched parameter counts, the serial circuit reaches the least-squares optimum in at most 9 runs
> under Adam and in 32 to 93 under Levenberg--Marquardt, the control in at least 98 and in all
> 100; its held-out error is up to about $1.5$ times that of the control under Adam, but no larger
> in the typical run under Levenberg--Marquardt.
